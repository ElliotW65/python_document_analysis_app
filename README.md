# F21SC Industrial Programming Python Individual Coursework

This is a Python-based application, that analyses and displays document tracking data from issuu.com with a description of the dataset being found at http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/Courses/F21SC/dataset_spec.html.

The application is run from the command line with the test execution commands being contained in “test_commands.txt” that utilise sample data in “test_data.json”.

One of the requirements on the application is the package httpagentparser which can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/httpagentparser/

For test command 6, the graphviz package and software is also required (found here: https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/), however, the test up to number 6 can be performed without the need for graphviz.

A demo of the application is provided in the “F21SC_Application_Screencast.mp4” and a technical report can be found in “F21SC_CW2_Report.pdf”.
